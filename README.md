*Definition of Project*

This project was in response to a 4 hour Design Sprint exercise, as a part of Tallahassee StartUp Week.
The project in question was: Help restaurants reduce food waste, while increasing revenue.

*Solution*

Our solution (for Team Left Foot Over, Left Thumb Over, Dog Tail on Left) was to minimize the menu choices, and optimize the use of raw materials (e.g. pot roast one day, BBQ beef sandwiches the next day from left over pot roast kind of thing.).

Along with that, was that the chef could create a daily Chef Surprise, to alleviate boredom in preparing the same things over and over again. 
The kicker is, he only makes 25 of those dishes, and when they're gone, they're gone. This had the effect of increasing customer demand, as they would make time to go if they wanted the Chef Surprise. The visual idea of this was to have a Wheel of Fortune like board (or an app) that the wait staff could rotate the numbers, making them disappear. The webpage is the visual representation of that.
It also included a contest portion, where the patrons could suggest a dish for the Chef Surprise, giving the Chef more options for the one item that changed daily. If the patron's meal was chosen, they would receive a free meal, courtesy of the restaurant.
 
The second part of our solution was to have the food on the plates (that were smaller plates) hide a Dad joke. This encourages you (and small children) to eat all the food on the plate in order to reveal what the joke is.

*Status:*

We mocked up several different  plates with Dad jokes written on them.
I created a webpage to mimick the numbers turning off as the Chef Surprise dishes were ordered. Due to a lack of time (4 hours start to finish), the initial presentation of this idea focused on Presentation, rather than Function, so this means that the numbers don't do anything for now. This README page will be updated once the code to make it interactive is complete and working.
